Yet Another MIPS Processor

A design of the seminal 5 stage pipeline that shall be easy to read,
clean VHDL code. Mainly an educational design. Might contain some FPGA
targeting optimizations.

Also a test case how long it takes to develop a MIPS pipeline, assuming
reasonable VHDL knowledge. Furthermore, we can leverage some work from
JOP, Leros, and Patmos.

5.11.2012: 2h45' Setup the project, create first VHDL files, ModelSim simulation,
                 a Quartus project
		 
6.11.2012: 1h00' Structure the records for registers, search for MIPS tools

7.11.2012: 1h15', 13:50- Build binutils
